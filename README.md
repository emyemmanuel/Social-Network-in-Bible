# Social-Network-in-Bible
Visualization and Analysis of a social network formed by the characters and places in Bible's Old Testament

Created a social network of characters from the Bible using the Zen library and Python.
Explored Gephi for the visualization of the network created. The network visualization was compared to the visualization developed by the HCI lab at CMU

The centrality measures, diameter and communities was analyzed within the network. A diffusion model was developed to visualize the transfer of information between characters.

Relationship between characters from the network was compared with existing data analysis.
